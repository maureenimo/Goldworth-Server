Next, we look at trees: examples of how they are used in Computer Science, how they are implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you have completed this course, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.",
